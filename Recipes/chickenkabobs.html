            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
                    <li>2 large chicken breasts (12 oz each)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 20 minutes 
                        while you prepare the chicken.
                    </li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Line a rimmed, 
                        broiler-safe baking sheet with foil.
                    </li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, salt, 
                        pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and thyme.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cut the chicken breasts into cubes as shown in the video. 
                        Add to the bowl and toss with the seasoned olive oil.
                    </li>
                    <li>Thread the coated chicken cubes on skewers. If you use 
                        wooden skewers, place thin foil strips on their exposed 
                        edges to prevent them from burning.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bake the kabobs until cooked through, for about 15 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Switch the oven to broil. Place the baking sheet under the 
                        broiler, and broil the chicken just until browned, for about 
                        1 minute. Serve immediately.
                    </li>
