                <h3>Meatballs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound ground beef 85% lean</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup parmesan cheese dry-grated</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Sauce</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened ketchup</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Line a large, rimmed 
                        baking sheet with high-heat-resistant parchment paper.
                    </li>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, use your hands to mix together the 
                        meatball ingredients: ground beef, kosher salt, black 
                        pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and parmesan.
                    </li>
                    <li>Form the mixture into 20 meatballs. It's easiest to shape 
                        the mixture into a log, slice it into five slices, then 
                        divide each slice into four parts and shape those into meatballs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Place the meatballs on the prepared baking sheet, not touching 
                        each other. Bake them until they are cooked through, about 15 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, whisk together the sauce ingredients: 
                        ketchup, maple syrup, soy sauce, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper.
                    </li>
                    <li>Five minutes before the meatballs should be done, heat the sauce 
                        gently over medium-low heat. If it seems too thick, add a tablespoon 
                        or two of water.
                    </li>
                    <li>When the meatballs are done baking, use tongs to transfer them to the 
                        sauce. Gently toss to coat. Serve immediately.
                    </li>
                </ol>
